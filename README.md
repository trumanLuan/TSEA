# TSEA
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing technologies have identified hundreds of thousands of disease-associated variants and genes. Interpretation of these variants could be greatly enhanced in tissue-specific systems. However, there are many diseases or traits where the causal tissues or cell types remain unknown. In many studies, tissue transcriptome data are generated for research, which include both genes that are ubiquitously expressed (e.g., housekeeping genes) and genes that are specifically expressed in a range of tissues. This documentation introduces Tissue-Specific Enrichment Analysis (TSEA), an R package to identify the most relevant tissues for candidate genes or for gene expression profiles. TSEA builds on two pre-processed reference panels. We implemented different statistic tests for different forms of query data. We demonstrate TSEA using multi-trait GWAS data and cancer RNA-sequencing data.
