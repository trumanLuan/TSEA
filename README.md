# TSEA
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing technologies have identified hundreds of thousands of disease-associated variants and genes. Interpretation of these variants could be greatly enhanced in tissue-specific systems. However, there are many diseases or traits where the causal tissues or cell types remain unknown. Tissue-Specific Enrichment Analysis (TSEA) is an R package to identify the most relevant tissues for candidate genes or for gene expression profiles. TSEA builds on two pre-processed reference panels. We implemented different statistic tests for different forms of query data.
